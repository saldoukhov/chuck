# Chuck

Chuck is a command-line interface to OpenAI applications such as ChatGPT.

## Requirements
+ Updated XCode.  If you get an error when runnning `xcrun`, do this:
   + `sudo rm -rf /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools`
   + `xcode-select --install`

## Building and Running
+ `$ ./gradlew build`

The output is in `build/bin/native/releaseExecutable`

If you have trouble compiling because the libcurl dependencies missing, install libcurl, f.e.
```shell
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y libcurl4-openssl-dev
```

## Using Chuck
Set an environment variable with your OPENAPI key from platform.openai.com:
```shell
# OpenAI Platform                                                                                                                                                                            
export OPENAI_API_KEY="srmo...39"                                                                                                                  
```
Set a useful alias:
```shell
$ alias chuck='..../build/bin/native/releaseExecutable/chuck.kexe gpt-4'
```

```shell
$ chuck
